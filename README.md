# OOP-Washhouse-Project-
This is my first project in C++ where i use the OOP concepts


 This project takes data from clients and wash their clothes .
 * When all the clothes of a customer's order have been processed, the total amount of detergent used and the total time spent in the machine while working were shown for that order
